#  Hello👋, I am Roland Mweze

<div align="center">
  <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 600px; margin: auto;">
    Software Engineer with 4+ years of hands-on experience building robust, scalable, and maintainable software solutions.
I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant, efficient code. My sweet spot? Creating enterprise-level applications that stand the test of time and scale.
    I've got a knack for the full SDLC and enjoy architecting systems from the ground up. Fintech and emerging tech? That's my jam. I am always keeping an eye on what's next in the industry.
    When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me strategizing my next move on the chess board. I am naturally a team player, bringing that same collaborative spirit to every project I tackle.
