My name is Roland MWEZE, I'm a software engineer and a tech enthousiast.<br>
My biggest challenge is to put my skills to the service of our communities, innovated by engineering for a smart and sustainable development.

  <ul>
   <li>I love take cofee &#9749; with friends and discuss about quantum physics</li>
   <li>I love travel ‚úà through the world and i'm curious on new discovery</li>
   <li> &#9203; I'm currently attending Full-Stack Software Development at MICROVERSE  </li>
  </ul> 
  
When i'm not writing code, i prefer to spend my time to read books, play chess <span style='font-size:50px;'>&#9823;</span> and create content of blog about discovery .
I'am interested about new challenges and new opportunities, feel free to contact me :
